WEEK 1:
This week I used AI mainly for simple clarifications on code. I would complete the tasks in the excercises then show My code to chatgpt & ask chatgpt to
go step by step on everything I did incorrecty. This includes syntax errors, logic errors, etc. for the most part it wasnt really difficult, I mainly used
it for clarification for this refresher of an assignment. I didnt use a chatgpt account for this so all the questions wont be in a link if I were to put
them there, but here's an example question I would ask:
"Hello chat is there anything wrong with the code? Please go step by step". & I would go from there.
